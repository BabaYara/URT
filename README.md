# URT
Fast Unit-Root Tests and OLS regression in C++ with wrappers for R and Python

# Description
URT is a library designed to procure speed while keeping a high level of flexibility for the user.

The core code is in C++ and based on three of the most widely used C++ linear algebra libraries: Armadillo, Blaze and Eigen. The user can switch from one library to another and compare performaces. While some are faster than other depending on array dimensions all of them have been given a chance as they are under active development and future updates might improve their respective performances. They can all be compiled by calling external libraries as for instance Intel MKL and OpenBLAS or by using their own BLAS/LAPACK wrappers.

URT can also be used under R and Python. The R version is currenty using Armadillo and developped under Rcpp using the RcppArmadillo R package. The Python version is currently using Blaze and developped under Cython.
URT contains an OLS regression and four of the most famous and most used unit-root tests: ADF, DF-GLS, Phillips-Perron and KPSS. ADF and DF-GLS allow for lag length optimization through different methods as information criterion minimization and t-statistic method. Test p-values can be computed via an extension of the method proposed by Cheung and Lai back in 1995 or by bootstrap. 

# Why such a project and how can you contribute ?
I have been developping tools for algorithmic trading for a while and it is no secret that unit-root tests are widely used in this domain to decide whether a time serie is (weakly) stationary or not and construct on this idea a profitable mean-reversion strategy. Nowadays you often have to look at smaller and smaller time frames to find such trading opportunities and that means on the back-testing side using more and more historical data to test whether the strategy can be profitable on the long term or not. I found frustrating that the available libraries under R and Python, which are commonly used in the first steps when building a trading algorithm, were too slow or did not offer enough flexibility. To that extent I wanted to develop a library that could be used under higher level languages to get a first idea on the profitability of a strategy and also when developping a more serious back-tester on a larger amount of historical data under a lower level language as C++. 

In algorithmic trading we have to find the right sample size to test for stationarity. If we use a too short sample of historica data on a rolling window the back-testing will be faster but the test precision will be smaller and the results will be less reliable, on the contrary if we use a too large sample the back-testing will be slower but the test precision will be greater and the results will be more reliable. Hence, when testing for stationarity we have to always keep this tradeoff in mind. Optimal sample size are in general between 100 to 2000, leading to relatively small size arrays. I have then decided not to use parallelism when calling Matrix/Vector operations as it would not bring any speed improvement and on the contrary would slow down the code when applied on such small dimensions. Although Armadillo does not allow for parallelism yet, Blaze and Eigen do, I made sure to turn off this ability. However, parallelism is used to speed up the lag length optimization by information criterion minimization in ADF and DF-GLS tests by using OpenMP. All of these libraries are now using vectorization (from SSE to AVX), activating this feature can improve greatly the general performance.

During my experimentations I have tried to find the correct set up for each C++ linear algebra library (Armadillo, Blaze and Eigen compiled with Intel MKL or OpenBLAS) in order to get the fastest results on a sample size of 1000. If anyone can find a faster configuration for one of them, or more generally, if anyone has anything to propose that could make the C++ code or the Cython and Rcpp wrappers faster, he is more than welcome to bring his contribution to this project.

# Innovation
Unit-root tests use lags in order to reduce auto-correlation as much as possible in the serie being tested. The test p-value is lag dependent as the critical values will be different depending on the number of lags, several studies have shown this dependency and it can easily been proved by Monte-Carlo simulations. However, very few unit-root tests librairies take this phenomenom into account and return wrong p-values for a large number of lags. The method used in this project is the one explained by Cheung and Lai in "Lag Order and Critical Values of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test" (1995). This method has been pushed further and adapted to other unit-root tests. 

The methodology is simple, starting from a chosen set of sample sizes and a chosen set of number of lags, it consists in 3 steps:
- step 1: generate a non-stationary random sample of a given size (Wiener process) for the case ADF, DF-GLS and Phillips-Perron tests and a stationary random sample of a given size (Gaussian noise) for the case the KPSS test
- step 2: compute the corresponding test statistic for a given number of lags
- repeat step 1 and 2 many times to get a sample of test statistics from a given couple (sample size, number of lags)
- step 3: sort the statistics sample obtained to get their distribution and record the critical value for each confidence level of your choice
- repeat step 1 to 3 for all combinations of sample size and number of lags and fit by OLS regression these critical values for each required significance level to the equation proposed by Cheung and Lai:

    ![screenshot from 2016-12-16 17-10-54](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20603093/21269345/b6abd474-c3b2-11e6-8247-d43163a11b39.png)
    
    where CR(N,k) is the critical value estimate for a sample of size N and a number of lags k (and for a given significance level), T = N - k being the effective number of observations and Epsilon(N,k) the model residuals

In order to increase the precision of the method some terms have been added by increasing degree of the first sum and/or the second sum, while trying to get significant heteroskedasticity consistent t-statistics for the regression coefficients obtained. Both sample sizes and number of lags sets proposed by Cheung and Kai have been expanded. For the most important critical values that is the ones at the confidence levels 1%, 5% and 10% for ADF, DF-GLS and Phillips-Perron tests and at 99%, 95% and 90% for the KPSS test, Monte-Carlo critical values have been computed using a high number of simulations and for reduced set of sizes and lags to compare and improve the estimated critical values precision by modifying the initial set of sizes and lags and by adding or removing some terms to the equation proposed by Cheung and Lai.

The coefficients obtained by OLS regression for each unit-root test and each significance level are reported in the header files in ./URT/include:
- Coeff_adf.hpp for ADF test
- Coeff_dfgls.hpp for DF-GLS test
- Coeff_pp.hpp for Phillips-Perron tests (t-statistic and normalized statistic)
- Coeff_kpss.hpp for KPSS test

NB: each index 0 array contains the asymptotic estimate of the critical value for the corresponding significance level *Tau(0)* and the coefficients of the first term of the equation *Tau(i)*, each index 1 array contains contains the coefficients of the second term of the equation *Phi(j)*.

# Requirements
To use this package you will need at least one of these three free C++ linear algebra libraries:
- Armadillo version >= 7.600.1
- Blaze version >= 3.0
- Eigen version >= 3.3.1

You will also need to have Boost C++ libraries already installed.

For better performance I recommend to link (dynamically or statistically) to Intel MKL or OpenBLAS for BLAS/LAPACK routines as the C++ linear algebra libraries will run faster especially Armadillo and Blaze, for Eigen there is almost no difference. All of these libraries will obviously need to be on your path.

NB: if you decide to link to Intel MKL or OpenBLAS, please use their sequential and not parallel version. Intel MKL let you the choice one intalled between the two versions, however OpenBLAS needs to be built from source as sequential with USE_THREAD=0. 
 
# Compilation
URT is not header only to provide a direct way to be exported as a shared library to Rcpp to be exposed to R and to Cython to be exposed to Python. Build the shared library using the provided makefile located in ./URT/build. The makefile has been written for Linux and GNU/gcc, it can be easily adapted to run under Windows or OSX and with another compiler, adapt this makefile to your own requirements. 

The three C++ linear algebra librairies use vectorization, it will be enabled for all of them when compiling with -march=native flag.

To build the shared library, the user can set the following variables:
- USE_OPENMP = 1 to activate parallelism in URT
- USE_BLAZE = 1 to use Blaze library
- USE_EIGEN = 1 to use Eigen library
- USE_MKL = 1 to use Intel MKL library
- USE_BLAS = 1 to use OpenBLAS library

The default configuration when running *make* is no parallelism and Armadillo with internal BLAS/LAPACK wrapers.

Example: *make USE_OPENMP=1 USE_BLAZE=1 USE_MKL=1* => the shared library libURT.so will be built using parallelism through OpenMP and with C++ linear algebra library Blaze using Intel MKL for BLAS/LAPACK routines.

NB: Armadillo does not need any external library for BLAS/LAPACK routines, however it needs to be linked to its shared library. Blaze can run with internal BLAS wrappers but needs to be linked to an external LAPACK library. Eigen can run without calling any external library.

## Example

- step 1: build libURT.so using the makefile under ./URT/build with:
```
$ make USE_OPENMP=1 USE_BLAZE=1 USE_MKL=1
```

- step 2: export shared library location with:
```
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/URT/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

- step 3: compile example1.cpp in ./URT/examples with:
```
$ g++ -std=c++14 -O3 -march=native -DUSE_ARMA -o run -L./URT/lib ./URT/examples/example1.cpp -lURT
```

- step 4: run executable with: 
```
$ ./run
``` 

You can repeat step 3 and 4 to compile other examples in ./URT/examples.

# Design

## Introduction
All URT classes and functions are within the namespace *urt*. As URT allows the use of three different linear algebra libraries, convienent typedefs Vector and Matrix have been defined for manipulating arrays:

- ### with Armadillo
    ```C++
    namespace urt {
       template <typename T>
       using Matrix = arma::Mat<T>;
       template <typename T>
       using Vector = arma::Col<T>;
    }
    ```

- ### with Blaze
    ```C++
    namespace urt {
       template <typename T>
       using Matrix = blaze::DynamicMatrix<T, blaze::columnMajor>;
       template <typename T>
       using CMatrix = blaze::CustomMatrix<T, blaze::unaligned, blaze::unpadded, blaze::columnMajor>;
       template <typename T>
       using Vector = blaze::DynamicVector<T>;
       template <typename T>
       using CVector = blaze::CustomVector<T, blaze::unaligned, blaze::unpadded>;
    }
    ```

- ### with Eigen
    ```C++
    namespace urt {
       template <typename T>
       using Matrix = Eigen::Matrix<T, Eigen::Dynamic, Eigen::Dynamic>;
       template <typename T>
       using Vector = Eigen::Matrix<T, Eigen::Dynamic, 1>;
    }
    ```

## C++ template class OLS:
Declared in ./URT/include/OLS.hpp, defined in ./URT/src/OLS.cpp.

To get fast unit-root tests, we need a fast and flexible OLS regression allowing to get the parameters (regressor coefficients) solution of the multiple linear equation y = X.b, as well as their variances to compute the t-statistics. These statistics will be used by the unit-root tests to decide whether the serie is (weakly) stationary or not.

- ### Constructor
    The OLS regression is run by declaring an OLS object using the following constructor:
    ```C++
    OLS<T>::OLS(const Vector<T>& y, const Matrix<T>& x, bool stats = false)
    ```
    with:
    - *y* = vector of the dependent variable
    - *x* = matrix of the independent variables (it can include intercept, constant trend, etc...)
    - *stats* if turned to *true*, additional statistics will be computed as R-squared, adjusted R-squared, F statistic and Durbin-Watson statistic
     
- ### Member variables (public)
   - *param* = regressors coefficients
   - *t_stat* = regressors t-statistics
   - *resid* = regression residuals
   - *var* = regressors variances
   - *MSE* = mean of squares for error
   - *SSR* = sum of squares residuals
   - *R2* = R-squared
   - *adj_R2* = adjusted R-squared
   - *F_stat* = F-statistic
   - *DW_stat* = Durbin-Watson test statistic
   - *IC* = information criterion
   - *nobs* = number of observations
   - *nreg* = number of regressors
   - *ndef* = number of degrees of freedom
   - *lags* = number of lags
    
NB: *IC* and *lags* are for the case when OLS is called by UnitRoot for lag length optimization by information criterion minimization.
    
- ### Member functions (public)
    - *get_stats()* takes same *x* and *y* as arguments as the constructor, computes the additional OLS regression statistics and detects the presence of an intercept term
    - *show()* outputs the results
    
- ### Additionnal tools (not members of OLS)
URT provides 3 functions located in ./URT/include/Tools.hpp, to add quickly constant terms to a Matrix object:
    - *add_intercept()* inserts a column of ones at the end of a *Matrix* object as shown in the example below
    - *add_constant_trend()* inserts a constant trend at the end of a *Matrix* object (1,2,3,...)
    - *add_quadratic_trend()* inserts a quadratic trend at the end of a *Matrix* object (1,4,9,...)
    
    In the same header are defined some functions generating random data for testing URT classes:
    - *gaussian_noise()* will generate a *Vector* or *Matrix* object of normally distributed random data (stationary process)
    - *wiener_process()* will generate a a *Vector* or *Matrix* object of Wiener processes (non-stationary process)
    
    The header ./URT/include/CsvManager.hpp contains functions for CSV files management:
    - *WriteToCSV()* will write a *Matrix* or *Vector* object to a CSV file
    - *ReadFromCSV()* will read a CSV file and store the data into a *Matrix* or *Vector* object

    Data can then be exported from C++ to R or Python to validate the results returned by URT wrappers.
    
- ### Code example:

    ```C++
    // ./URT/examples/example1.cpp
    #include "../include/URT.hpp"

    int main()
    {
       int nrows = 1000;
       int ncols = 10;

       // generating random arrays
       urt::Vector<double> y = urt::wiener_process<double>(nrows);
       urt::Matrix<double> x = urt::wiener_process<double>(nrows, ncols);

       // adding intercept to matrix of independent variables
       urt::add_intercept(x);
       
       // writting data to CSV files
       urt::WriteToCSV("./URT/data/y.csv", y);
       urt::WriteToCSV("./URT/data/x.csv", x);

       // running OLS regression
       urt::OLS<double> fit(y, x, true);

       // outputting regression results
       fit.show();
    }   
    ```

    Durbin-Watson statistic            0.106
    ```
    
NB: the choice has been made not to copy Vector and Matrix, arguments of OLS constructor for performance reasons. Indeed, when the Matrix becomes large it can quickly lead to a significative difference in term of performance. Also, if *stats* has not been set to *true* the function *get_stats()* will not be called and the intercept will not be detected in the output.

## C++ template class UnitRoot
Declared in ./URT/include/UnitRoot.hpp, defined in ./URT/src/UnitRoot.cpp.

Abstract base class from which all unit-root tests will inherit, it contains all the variables and functions the derived classes ADF, DFGLS, PP and KPSS will need.

- ### Member variables (public)

    - *method* = method for lag length optimization, for ADF and DF-GLS tests only, possible choices are:
        - *AIC* = Aikaike Information Criterion
        - *BIC* = Bayesian Information Criterion
        - *HQC* = Hannah-Quinn Criterion
        - *MAIC* = Modified Aikaike Information Criterion
        - *MBIC* = Modified Bayesian Information Criterion
        - *MHQC* = Modified Hannah-Quinn Criterion
        - *T-STAT* = optimal lag length selection using (absolute) threshold
    - *test_type* for Phillips-Perron test only, possibles choices are:
        - *tau* = t-statistic test (default value)
        - *rho* = normalized statistic test
    - *trend* = regression trend, possible choices are:
        - *nc* = no constant (for ADF and PP tests only)
        - *c* = constant (for all tests, default value)
        - *ct* = constant trend (for all tests)
        - *ctt* = quadratic trend (for ADF test only)
    - *level* = statistic (absolute) threshold for optimal lag length selection, for T-STAT method only, set to *1.64* by default
    - *lags* = model number of lags
    - *max_lags* = maximum number of lags, for models with lag length optimization, initialized to Schwert l12-rule by default
    - *niter* = number of iterations when computing test p-value by bootstrap, initialized to 1000 by default
    - *bootstrap* = if set to *true*, test p-value will be computed by bootstrap, set to *false* by default
    - *regression* = if set to *true*, OLS regression results will be outputted when running *show()* method, set to *false* by default
    
- ### Member functions (public)
    - *get_stat()* to return the test statistic
    - *get_pval()* to return the test p-value
    - *get_ols()* to return the OLS regression results (returns object of type urt::OLS)
    - *get_trends()* to return possible trends for the current test (returns std::vector)
    
    This class has also 3 pure virtual functions:
    - *statistic()* computes the test statistic
    - *pvalue()* calls *statistic()* and computes the p-value
    - *show()* calls *pvalue()* and outputs the test results
    
 NB: UnitRoot template class is designed in a way that test statistic and test p-value will not be re-calculated if all parameters remain identical. For example, if user calls *pvalue()* method and after *show()*, *pvalue()* will not be run again unless the user has modified at least one parameter of the current test.  

## C++ template class ADF

       // initializing ADF test with 10 lags and constant trend
       urt::ADF<double> test(data, 10, "ct");

       // outputting test results
       test.show();
    
       // switching to test with lag length optimization and p-value computation by bootstrap with 10000 iterations
       test.method = "AIC";
       test.bootstrap = true;
       test.niter = 10000;
    
       // outputting test results

## C++ template class PP
Declared in ./URT/include/PP.hpp, defined in ./URT/src/PP.cpp.

Derived template class from UnitRoot, this class has 2 constructors:

- ### Constructor for computing Phillips-Perron test for a given number of lags
    ```C++
    PP(const Vector<T>& data, int lags, const std::string& trend = "c", const std::string& test_type = "tau", bool regression = false)
    ```
    
- ### Constructor for computing Phillips-Perron test with a default number of lags (long or short)
    ```C++
    PP(const Vector<T>& data, const std::string& lags_type, const std::string& trend = "c", const std::string& test_type = "tau", bool regression = false)
    ``` 
    
- ### Code example:
    ```C++
    // ./URT/examples/example4.cpp
    #include "./URT/include/URT.hpp"

    int main()
    {
       int nobs = 1000;

       // generating non-stationary random data
       urt::Vector<float> data = urt::wiener_process<float>(nobs);
       
       // initializing Phillips-Perron normalized test with lags of type long and constant term

## URT under Python
URT is exposed to Cython to be imported from Python. URT will call the C++ linear algebra library Blaze, you need first to have built URT shared library using Blaze, to compile the Cython code and build the shared library that will be imported from python, use ./URT/python/setup.py
